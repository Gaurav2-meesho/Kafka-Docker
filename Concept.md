# Key concepts:
## Partitions
Think of a topic as a folder and partitions as separate files inside it.
Kafka decides which partition a message goes to using:
- A key (if provided)
- Otherwise: sticky/round-robin strategy

## Consumer Group
A consumer group is a set of consumers that share the work of consuming from a topic.
- Kafka assigns each partition to only one consumer in a group.
- But different groups can consume the same topic independently.

<b>Kafka guarantees: each partition is read by only one consumer in a group at a time.</b>

## Partition-to-Consumer Mapping Rules
| #Partitions | #Consumers in Group | Behavior                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 3           | 1                   | One consumer reads from all partitions                 |
| 3           | 2                   | One gets 2 partitions, one gets 1                      |
| 3           | 3                   | One-to-one mapping                                     |
| 3           | 4                   | One partition per consumer; extra consumer is **idle** |

# üß†Example Scenario
## Topic: user-logins (4 partitions)
üë• Consumer Group: analytics-group
| Partition | Assigned Consumer |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| 0         | consumer-1        |
| 1         | consumer-2        |
| 2         | consumer-3        |
| 3         | consumer-4        |

If consumer-2 crashes:
- Kafka reassigns partition 1 to one of the remaining consumers.
- Messages are not lost ‚Äî offsets ensure safe resumption.

üîÑ How Kafka Distributes Messages to Partitions
When a producer sends a message, Kafka decides which partition it should go to using the following logic:
| Key Provided? | Kafka Version | Partitioning Method         |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Yes         | Any           | Hash(key) % num\_partitions |
| ‚ùå No          | ‚â§ 2.3         | Round-robin                 |
| ‚ùå No          | ‚â• 2.4         | Sticky partitioning         |
